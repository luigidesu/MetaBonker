This script gets rid of all your images metadata.
But, can't I do that in Photoshop already?
Yes, but it is still some metadata there, like your Photoshop version and such, and I'm a paranoic son of a bitch who doesn't like to get tracked down, so I want to get rid of ALL MY IMAGES METADATA
So yeah, it gets rid of the meta.
